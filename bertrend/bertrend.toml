# Indicates if BERTrend shall use local embedding service (run by BERTrend) or if the embedding service
# is delegated to an external service. If set to false, the other properties shall be set properly.
# It is generally more efficient to use a dedicated service for embeddings.

# - the official OpenAI endpoint
# - models deployed on a Azure cloud
